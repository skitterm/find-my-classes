Due to the nature of the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS, the arcgis.bundle file is not transferred upon commit. Thus,
before building the project, it will be necessary to install the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS. Detailed instructions
are available here: https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/info/install.htm
